# nugget-standards
This repository is a collection of standards, aimed to unify interactions between smart contracts. While its primary aim is to make interaction between projects/contracts of the Nugget Network easier, we are more than happy for everyone else to utilize them as well, which is why we all interfaces come with the permissive MIT license.
